We made this Application as our semester project also we hope it could be used as an extension for video conference applications so that deaf people can interact online easily with others.

The App Consists of 3 main modules.

1- Deep Learning Model.

2- Hand Detection.

3- Auto Correction.

## How to Run

 - You Can run the Application by simply openning hand_detector module then press f5.
 - You can also open hand_detector using python IDLE then from run window choose run module


## Important Notes

- Model Trainning Process is Done seperately using Kaggle.
- To get the best efficiency from this application please make sure to run it in a bright place with plain background.
